 *
 * 2026-09-18 investigation note: tixcraft's detail page routinely took 5-9s
 * between domcontentloaded and its own "#intro" tab content actually
 * appearing (measured directly — goto() itself was consistently under 1s, so
 * the delay is real client-side rendering time, not network latency). Tried
 * blocking images/fonts/media and known ad/analytics hosts via page.route()
 * to speed that up — a small 5-event sample looked genuinely faster (~4s vs
 * ~7-9s), but a full 79-event run right after came back SLOWER overall with
 * far more 20s timeouts than any previous run (18/79 vs a handful before).
 * The likely cause isn't the blocking itself: by that point this debugging
 * session had made 150+ rapid detail-page requests to tixcraft within about
 * half an hour (several full-adapter test runs back to back), which plausibly
 * tripped some session-based bot-suspicion scoring on their end (the adapter
 * comment above already documents this being an Akamai/PerimeterX-style JS
 * challenge) — blocking ad/analytics requests is also a known bot-detection
 * signal some sites specifically watch for, so it may have made things worse
 * on top of that, or may be unrelated; the two effects couldn't be told apart
 * from a single noisy run. Reverted rather than ship an unconfirmed change
 * with a plausible downside — not worth risking degrading a real data source
 * over a speed optimization that isn't verified to actually help. If
 * revisited, retest on a fresh day/session with real gaps between runs so a
 * single test isn't itself the confound.
